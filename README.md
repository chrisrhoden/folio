The folio.

This is a little site for your portfolio. It tracks the things I think are
important to show off. Specifically, it tracks the tools that you use in
your projects.

Why?

The way that you learn how to use a particular language, framework, or library
is by using it on a whole bunch of projects. The first time, you may not get it,
but the second time, you will learn how better to use it and the third time you
will be even better.

By emphasizing how often you use certain tools, you get a much better idea of what
tools you use every day and what tools you should probably either think about
using in your next project or scrapping altogether.
